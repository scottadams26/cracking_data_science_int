        "\n",
        "This Python notebook provides an outline of results that could be provided in a typical take-home assessment for a data science interview. The goal of this exercise is to develop a model that can predict whether a given job candidate will leave their current job to come work for your company. That is, you need to predict whether a given candidate has a value of `1` (Looking for a job change) on the target. The datasets and associated information are taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uniabhi/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists). Note that there are two datasets, `aug_train.csv` and `aug_test.csv`, which are CSV files containing the training and testing sets for this exercise. \n",
